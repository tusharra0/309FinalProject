This document details how AI tools (specifically Cursor and Antigravity AI) were used in the development 
of this project, primarily for scaffolding and ensuring responsive design.

SCAFFOLDING
-----------

1. Project Structure Setup
   - AI was used to scaffold the initial project structure, including:
     * Frontend folder organization (pages, components, routes, context, api, styles)
     * Separation of concerns following MVC-like patterns

2. Frontend Scaffolding
     * Auth pages (Login, Signup, PasswordReset, VerifyEmail)
   
   - Reusable Components: AI scaffolded common components:
     * Navbar.jsx - Navigation component
     * LoadingSpinner.jsx - Loading states
     * ErrorMessage.jsx - Error display
     * SuccessMessage.jsx - Success notifications
     * Pagination.jsx - Pagination controls
     * FeatureCard.jsx - Feature display cards
     * BlobBackground.jsx - Decorative background
   
   - Routing Structure: AI set up React Router configuration with:
     * ProtectedRoute.jsx - Route protection
     * RoleRedirect.jsx - Role-based redirects
     * AppLayout.jsx - Layout wrapper

3. Database Schema
   - AI assisted in designing the Prisma schema with:
     * Junction tables for many-to-many relationships
     * Converting our schema to Postgres
   
   - Seed Data: AI generated comprehensive seed data including:
     * Multiple user accounts with different roles
     * Sample promotions
     * Sample events
     * Various transaction types (purchase, transfer, redemption, event, adjustment)

RESPONSIVENESS
--------------

1. Tailwind CSS Configuration
   - AI configured Tailwind CSS for responsive design:
     * Set up tailwind.config.js with custom theme
     * Configured PostCSS for processing
     * Added responsive breakpoints and utilities

2. Responsive Component Design
   - AI ensured all components use Tailwind's responsive utilities:
     * Mobile-first approach with sm:, md:, lg:, xl: breakpoints
     * Responsive grid layouts for dashboards
     * Responsive navigation (mobile menu, desktop navbar)
     * Responsive forms and input fields
